# Staking Eligibility

## **Overview**

Staking Eligibility is an eligibility module for Hats Protocol. It requires wearers of a given hat to stake a minimum amount of a specified token in order to be eligible, and enables others in the Hats tree's organization to slash the stake of a wearer who is behaving badly.

## **Using the Staking Eligibility Module**

_This eligibility module is currently in beta. Contact us at support \[at] hatsprotocol \[dot] xyz if you want to explore this module, or_ [_check out the Staking Eligibility Github repo here_](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/staking-eligibility/)_._
