# Staking Eligibility

## **Overview**

Staking Eligibility is an eligibility module for Hats Protocol. It requires wearers of a given hat to stake a minimum amount of a specified token in order to be eligible, and enables others in the Hats tree's organization to slash the stake of a wearer who is behaving badly.

The module's code is open source and is available [here](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/staking-eligibility).

## **Using the Staking Eligibility Module**

* Go to the tree that includes the hat you wish to create the module for
