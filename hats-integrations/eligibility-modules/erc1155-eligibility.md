# ERC1155 Eligibility

## **Overview**

A Hats eligibility module that makes addresses eligible to wear a given hat only if they have a specified minimum balance of specific ERC1155 token(s), as identified by contract address and token ID. This eligibility module can be configurable to support both single-token criteria as well as multiple-token criteria, where the balance requirement is configurable for each token.

The module's code is open source and is available [here](https://github.com/pumpedlunch/HatsEligibilityModules/blob/master/src/MultiERC1155EligibilityModule.sol).
