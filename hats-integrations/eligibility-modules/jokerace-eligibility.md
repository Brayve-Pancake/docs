# JokeRace Eligibility

## **Overview**

[JokeRace](https://jokerace.xyz/) enables communities to make, execute, and reward decisions onchain. By using this module, communities can elect the wearers of a hat through a JokeRace contest. More specifically, the eligible wearers are creators of the top voted proposals in the JokeRace.

The number of winners of a JokeRace, and thus the number of possible wearers made eligible through this integration, is configurable. Additionally, a term period can be set, after which the winners will no longer be eligible to wear the hat.

_This eligibility module is currently in beta. Contact us at support \[at] hatsprotocol \[dot] xyz if you want to explore this module._
