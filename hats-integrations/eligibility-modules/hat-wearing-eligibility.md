# Hat-Wearing Eligibility

A Hats Protocol eligibility module that conditions eligibility for one hat based on wearing another hat.

One use of a hat is to serve as an encapsulation of a set of logic and conditions that serve as baseline eligibility criteria for other hats. This eligibility module builds on that idea by allowing a hat to be used as an eligibility criterion for another hat.

The module's code is open source and is available [here](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hat-wearing-eligibility/tree/main).&#x20;
