# âš¡ Toggle Modules

Hats Modules are programmable extensions for roles. Modules can be connected to hats to expand their functionality, such as enabling automatic deactivation and reactivation of hats (and their associated permissions) based on specific conditions.&#x20;

For more details on Hats Modules, including what they can unlock and how builders can create new modules, [see this blog post](https://hats.mirror.xyz/xAk\_yb7dDL1OLBx8nq47Ni7V1SuiC6L6B-49u7vz520) and follow this [link](../../using-hats/setting-accountabilities/toggle-activating-and-deactivating-hats.md) for a general guide about Toggle Modules.

See the subpages within this section for detailed guides for specific Toggle modules you can use with Hats:

## Digging Deeper

For more technical details on how Hats toggle modules work, see the [Toggle Modules](../../for-developers/hats-protocol-overview/toggle-modules.md) page within the "For Developers" section of these docs.

## Building Modules

Modules customize, automate, and extend the behavior of Hats Protocol, and can also serve as adapters or integration points with other protocols and applications.

In a sense, modules are the lifeblood of Hats Protocol. The design space is wide open, ready to be filled with all the possible building blocks of human organization and coordination.

There are two primary ways for developers to work with Hats Modules. Whether you're [building new modules](../../for-developers/hats-modules/building-hats-modules/) or using the [Modules SDK](../../for-developers/hats-modules/modules-sdk/) to interact with or build applications for existing modules, we have a number of developer tools to make your job easier. See the page below to get started.
