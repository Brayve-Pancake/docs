# ğŸ¥³ Adding Wearers

Hats tokens can be held by any address including an EOA, multisig, or contract. When an address has a balance of 1 of a given Hats token, it is considered a "wearer" of that "hat". Then, by way of various token-gates, that address is granted the [authorities](connecting-hats-with-authorities.md) that have been associated with that hat.

Each hat can have any number of wearers up to the hatâ€™s max supply. Hats are granted and revoked by the organization, or agents/smart contracts that are designated by the org. Wearers can renounce a hat, but they cannot transfer it.

### How to add new wearers for a given hat

To add new wearers for a specific hat:

* Locate and select the hat in the [Hats app](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz)
* Select "Add a wearer"

Then, add an address or ENS that is controlled by the intended wearer _(note: ensure the address is on the same chain as your Hats tree)_, and select "Mint Hat".

To add multiple wearers with one transaction, enter multiple addresses by using the checkmark to add additional addresses, or upload a .csv containing a list of wearer addresses.

All the wearers of that hat will be shown in the sidebar under "Hat Wearer"

Once wearers are added, they can use the [Hats app](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz) to view the hats they're wearing by selecting "My Hats", see the associated responsibilities and authorities they hold, renounce a hat they are wearing, create new child hats underneath hats they are wearing, and make changes to any hats they are an admin of.
