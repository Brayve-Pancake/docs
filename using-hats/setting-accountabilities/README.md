# ✅ Setting Accountabilities

In Hats Protocol, the powers that are often bundled together in an admin role (like a traditional boss) are decoupled into three distinct parts to enable greater flexibility. They are:

* **Admins:** specific hats that can change a given hat's details, image, max supply, eligibility address, and toggle address — as long as that hat is mutable (immutable hats cannot be changed once created). Admin hats can also mint both mutable and immutable hats to new wearers, and transfer mutable hats from one address to another.
* **Eligibility:** an address that determines who can wear a given hat, or whether a wearer should have their hat revoked (this can be an agent or self-enforcing logic).
* **Toggle:** an address that determines whether and when a given hat should continue to exist (this can be an agent or self-enforcing logic).

Each of the above can be used in creative ways to cultivate a web of accountabilities across your group that ensures that people actually follow through on the responsibilities they're committing to by wearing a given hat.

Admins, Eligibility, and Toggle are explained in more detail in the pages below:
