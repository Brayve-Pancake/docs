# ðŸ‘‹ Renouncing Your Hat

1. **Visit the Hats Protocol App:** https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/

2. **Sign in with the correct wallet.**
   The address you sign in with must be a wearer of the hat you intend to renounce.

3. **Select the hat you wish to Renounce.**
   You will now see a Hat's tree at a URL like: `https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/...`

4. **Click Renounce in the corresponding kebab-menu.**
   In the right side-panel, you will see a heading named "Hat Wearers". Click the kebab-menu (the "more" button), then click renounce.

**Note:** You will only see the option to renounce your Hats, you will not see renounce as an option for other wearers of the same Hat.
