**What is the difference between Hats vs Hats Protocol vs Hats App?**

* Hats: the meme üß¢
* [Hats Protocol](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol): the open-source roles protocol upon which many different apps and integrations will be developed
* [Hats App](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/): a front-end app developed to make it easy for anyone to use the protocol

**How are Hats different from membership NFTs?**

Hats are like membership NFTs in that they are nontransferable, revocable, and grant access to a group of some kind. But they are also highly programmable, automatable, boosted by a wide range of eligibility modules and integrations that are being created, and nested with deterministic IDs to enable flexible governance structures for almost any need you can imagine.

**Can I "claim" my hat or does it have to be granted by someone else?**

Both are possible! Hats can be [granted (aka "minted")](adding-wearers.md) to new wearers by wearers of any existing [admin hat](admins-creating-issuing-and-revising-hats.md), OR hats can be claimed by eligible wearers [provided the hat has been made claimable](../hats-integrations/hatter-modules/multi-claims-hatter.md).&#x20;

**Can I renounce a hat if I no longer want to be part of the DAO?**

Yes! Any hat can be renounced by any wearer at any time. To renounce a hat you are wearing: select the hat in the Hats app, find your address under "Hat Wearers", select the three dots next to your address, and select "Renounce".

**What will happen with my Hats if I change my wallet address for whatever reason?**

Your hats will stay with the wallet address they were originally minted to. However, you can request to transfer your hats to a new address, as any admin can transfer a hat from one address to another using the "Transfer" function seen in the image above.

**How are responsibilities different than authorities?**&#x20;

* Responsibilities are the things a given hat wearer is expected to do as part of their role (e.g., a responsibility of the product workstream facilitator is to set the agenda for each product workstream meeting)
* Authorities are the permissions granted to the hat wearer (e.g., read/write access to specific communication channels or workspaces).
