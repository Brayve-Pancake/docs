# Hats Trees

The ability of a hat to be an admin of other Hats creates the possibility for a "tree" of hats, a structure of hats serving as admins of other hats. This is useful because it enables a DAO to snip off, but not destroy, a rogue branch by revoking the offending Hat. It could then re-assign that Admin Hat to another wearer.

Within a given branch of a hat tree, Hats closer to the root of the tree have admin authorities for Hats further down the branch. This is consistent with the direction of delegation of authority for DAOs, and combats the tendency for accountability to dilute as delegated authorities reach the edges of a network.

### **Top Hats**

Top Hats are the one exception to the rule that a hat's admin must be another hat. A Top Hat is a hat that serves as its own admin.

The root of a Hat tree is always a Top Hat. Typically, a DAO will wear the Top Hat that serves as admin for the tree of Hats related to the DAO's operations.

### Hat Trees and Hat Ids

Every hat's id describes its location within it's tree. See the following page for more detail on hat ids.
