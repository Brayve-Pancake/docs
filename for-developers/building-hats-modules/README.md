# ðŸ§© Building Hats Modules

A Hats Module is any contract that serves as an [Eligibility module](../hats-protocol-overview/eligibility-modules.md), a [Toggle module](../hats-protocol-overview/toggle-modules.md), and/or a [Hatter contract](../hats-protocol-overview/hat-admins-and-hatter-contracts.md#hatter-contracts). Modules customize, automate, and extend the behavior of Hats Protocol, and can also serve as adapters or integration points with other protocols and applications.

### Infinite Possibilities

As organizational building blocks, the modules design space is as rich and wide as the space of possible human coordination. This is exactly where open-source code shines - allowing anyone to express their creativity, designing & creating new modules and bringing ideas into reality.

### Ecosystem Of Users & Developers&#x20;

With our infrastructure, new modules are automatically usable by end users on the [Hats App](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/) or on any other user facing applications that are built with the Modules SDK. Our goal is enabling module developers to focus on the creation of valuable organizational building blocks, while we're taking care for the rest.

### Easy To Get Started

Our tools and docs are built in order to help developers to get started easily. Additionally, the Hats developer community is here for anyone to get technical support, answer questions and explore/share ideas. Join [this](https://t.me/+HrcKPUxaWvg3Zjhh) Hats developers channel on Telegram.
