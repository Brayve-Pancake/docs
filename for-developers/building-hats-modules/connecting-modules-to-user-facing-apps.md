# Connecting Modules To User Facing Apps

Once a module is ready for use, consider adding it to the [Modules Registry](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/modules-registry).&#x20;

Hats Protocol is open and permission-less, and so anyone is free to use any compatible modules on the protocol level.&#x20;

The registry is a curated modules database, used by tools and apps in the Hats ecosystem. Its purpose is to serve users and developers, by creating a standard of safety and usability for modules, which will eventually be governed by the Hats community.&#x20;

Modules that are included in the registry are natively supported in the [Hats App](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/) and the Modules SDK.

To add a module, follow the documentation [here](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/modules-registry/blob/main/README.md).
